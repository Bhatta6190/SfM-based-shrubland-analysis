## SfM-based Vegetation Structure Analysis in Fynbos Shrublands

This project explores the use of **structural metrics** derived from **UAS-based 3D point clouds**, generated using **structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry**, to assess post-fire vegetation structure and biodiversity in the **fynbos biome** of the Cape Floristic Region, South Africa.  

**Key Highlights:**
- Focused on **low-stature Mediterranean-type shrublands**, where vegetation traits are less studied.
- Extracted three structural metrics: **canopy height**, **top rugosity**, and **surface gap ratio**.
- Achieved **~85% accuracy** in classifying 5 Ã— 5 m subplots by burn year using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**.
- Structural metrics significantly contributed to modeling **species diversity**.
- Demonstrates the value of **UAS-derived metrics** for ecological monitoring and conservation strategies.
